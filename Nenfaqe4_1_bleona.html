<pre><h2>THE PRECIOUS GEMSTONE DIAMOND</h2> <img src="diamanti.jpg" alt="Diamond Stone" width="80" height="60">
    Diamonds are extremely rare, with concentrations of at most parts per billion in source 
    rock. Before the 20th century, most diamonds were found in alluvial deposits. Loose 
    diamonds are also found along existing and ancient shorelines, where they tend to accumulate 
    because of their size and density. Rarely, they have been found in glacial till (notably in 
    Wisconsin,Indiana), but these deposits are not of commercial quality. These types of deposit
    were derived from localized igneous intrusions through weathering and transport by wind, water.

       <h2>The quality of a diamond</h2>
        <p> One of the first things most people learn about diamonds is that not
        all diamonds are created equal. In fact, every diamond is unique. Diamonds
        come in many sizes, shapes, colors, and with various internal characteristics.
        All polished diamonds are valuable. That value is based on a combination of factors
        . Rarity is one of those factors. Diamonds with certain qualities are more rare—and
         more valuable—than diamonds that lack them.
         These are known as the 4Cs. When used together, they describe the quality of a finished diamond. The value of a finished diamond is based on this combination.
         A diamond’s value is often affected by the rarity of one or more of the 4Cs.
         Colorless diamonds are scarce—most diamonds have tints of yellow or brown. 
         So a colorless diamond rates higher on the color grading scale than a diamond 
         that is light yellow. Value and rarity are related: In this case a colorless 
         diamond is more rare and more valuable than one with a slight yellow color. 
         The same relationship between rarity and value exists for clarity, cut, and carat weight.</p>

          <h2>The finest diamond</h2>
             <p1The Cullinan, the largest gem quality diamond ever found, was discovered at
            the Premier Mine on 26th January 1905. The rough diamond was nearly flawless
            and named the Cullinan in honour of Sir Thomas Cullinan, the founder of the Premier Mine
            ,who was visiting that very day. Louis Botha, premier of the Transvaal, persuaded his 
            government to buy the diamond for approx. US $1 million and presented it to England’s
             King Edward VII as a token of thanks for granting Transvaal its own constitution.
           The Cullinan was handed to Amsterdam’s House of Asscher to polish. The diamond was divided into
           9 major gemstones, 96 smaller stones and about 19.5cts of unpolished pieces. The two largest
           gems were kept for England’s regalia and the rest went to Asscher as payment. King Edward bought 
           one of the major gems for his consort, Queen Alexandra. The Transvaal government bought 
           the remaining stones and pieces, and presented the other 6 major gems to Queen Mary in 1910. 
           Two of the small stones were presented to Louis Botha, who gave one to his daughter when she turned 17.

              <h2>Why would you use diamond?</h2>
              <p>We are all familiar with the beauty of a diamond set in an engagement ring, earrings, a pendant,
                 and other fine jewelry. However, due to their superior strength and unique properties, diamonds
                can be used for a number of different things outside of jewelry.Read on for just a few of the 
                many different industries that are using diamonds in both new and exciting and tried and true ways.
                he most common uses for diamonds outside of fine jewelry are for industrial applications. 
                Because diamonds are so strong (scoring a 10 on the Mohs Hardness Scale), they are extremely 
                effective at polishing, cutting, and drilling. Many industries – including automotive, mining,
                 and military – use diamond saws and drills.Small diamond particles are added to drill bits 
                 and saw edges to make them more powerful for cutting tough materials
